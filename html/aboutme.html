          <p>
            /ef-ei-di-ti/. I am an independent music producer from Purwokerto. Previously I was known as ARJF and have released 3 music namely Wave, Rainy, and Japanese Insen. I learned to make music by myself through YouTube and started
            making music in 2018.
          </p>
          <p>
            The music I make is EDM and the subgenres I usually make are Electro House, Progressive House, Trap, Future Bass, and Instrumental Hip-hop. I publish my music on Instagram, YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud, etc. The software I use
            is FL Studio and Caustic 3. I've made dozens of music so far and counting as time goes by.

          <p>
            I like to drink tea and the first two letters of my name are FA, which is why he is known as FADT which stands for (FA) (D)rinking (T)ea. Besides music production, I am interested in web development and design. I made this web
            with HTML, CSS, and JS by myself through YouTube.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have made several webs so far and this is one of them. I designed the FADT logo, cover art for music, and other simple designs using Figma. I'm also still improving my English, I'm also learning Japanese for additional skills.
